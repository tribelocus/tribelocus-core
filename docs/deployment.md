# Deployment of TribeLocus

Deploying TribeLocus is an act of care. It’s not just about uptime — it’s about emotional trust.

This platform holds human voice, tone, and vulnerability. Every deployment must honor that. This guide walks through how to launch TribeLocus responsibly — with clarity, intention, and minimal risk.

---

## Deployment Principles

- **No data movement without consent.**
- **No environments that “watch” users.**
- **No background automations that escape human awareness.**
- **All tools must serve emotional safety first — or they’re not used.**

---

## Environment Structure

### Development (Local + Safe)
- Local testing uses containerized environments (Docker) or direct services (Node, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Voice reflections are simulated or used only in safe, non-stored ways
- Secrets handled via `.env` or local secure store — never exposed

### Production (AWS, Privacy-First)
- Region: `us-east-1` (U.S.-based but modifiable for trust alignment)
- Services used:
  - **S3** – Optional voice and tone summary storage (only with explicit user consent)
  - **Lambda** – Voice analysis (Whisper), tone detection, emotional summary creation
  - **API Gateway** – Secure API access, throttled and signed
  - **Redis** – Temporary emotional context caching (not long-term session tracking)
  - **RDS (PostgreSQL)** – Core metadata storage (tone summaries, user state, role-based permissions)
  - **CloudFront** – Secure media and reflection delivery (with signed URLs)
- All network traffic is HTTPS-only
- IAM roles are minimally scoped and human-reviewed

## Voice Reflection Flow (Consent Path)

1. **User speaks.** Nothing is stored by default.
2. **Voice is processed in-memory** via Lambda/Whisper/GPT-4o.
3. **Only if the user requests saving** is the reflection uploaded to S3 (encrypted).
4. **Tone summary is created.** It is passed back to the user or stored temporarily.
5. **Trainer/Admin access** is gated and available *only if* the user shares the reflection.

There is no default saving. There is no silent forwarding. Every layer asks for permission before it acts.

---

## Deployment Process (Intentional + Minimal)

1. Clone the secure GitHub repository (private or access-controlled)
2. Set `.env` or AWS Secrets Manager values (no hardcoded keys)
3. Deploy infrastructure:
   - Manually via AWS Console  
   - Or intentionally using Terraform or AWS SAM (no auto-merge)
4. Connect voice processing to Whisper + GPT-4o (manual model key entry)
5. Deploy backend (Node, Python, etc.) and frontend (Next.js or static) separately
6. Test voice loop + emotional feedback fully in staging
7. Deploy only when verified in real-time by a human (no auto-pushes)

---

## CI/CD Ethos

We use GitHub for source control, but TribeLocus does not rely on fully automated deployment pipelines.

- **All deployments require human review.**
- **No production push is automatic.**
- **Tone-related model updates require conscious testing.**

This ensures every deployment carries human accountability.

---

## Logging & Monitoring

- We log only:
  - System health
  - Explicit errors
  - Consent events (e.g. “user chose to store reflection”)
- Logs expire within 24 hours unless flagged for integrity review
- No user behavior is tracked for analysis or marketing

---

## In Closing

This is not just a system. It’s a place where someone’s truth is heard.

We deploy it the same way we built it — one breath at a time, with reverence for what it holds.

If a tool or process does not align with human dignity, we leave it out. That is the deployment standard.
