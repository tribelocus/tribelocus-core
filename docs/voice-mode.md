# Voice Mode

Voice Mode is the heart of the user experience in TribeLocus. It’s where presence becomes real — not through content, but through tone, rhythm, and trust.

Unlike other systems, TribeLocus doesn’t use voice to capture commands. It uses voice to *receive people*. Gently. Privately. In real time.

## What Voice Mode Is

Voice Mode allows users to speak freely, without needing to write, scroll, or perform. It’s designed for:
- Emotional reflection
- Self-awareness
- Gentle AI presence
- Optional tone-based feedback

There is no required prompt. No expectation to explain. Just a single invitation: *Speak when you’re ready.*

---

## Key Principles

- **No storage by default.** Reflections disappear unless the user requests otherwise.
- **Tone comes first.** What you say matters — but how you say it shapes the response.
- **Presence is the product.** There is no outcome to achieve. Only a space to feel what’s real.
- **Minimal interface.** One centered thought. One microphone. One breath at a time.

## How It Works (Flow)

1. **User taps “Begin.”**
2. A soft, minimalist screen invites them to speak.
3. Audio is captured locally or streamed securely (S3, no storage unless chosen).
4. AI receives the tone, rhythm, and emotional signal using Whisper + GPT-4o.
5. A quiet reflection is returned — either:
   - A gentle mirror (“You sound tired, but honest. I’m here.”)
   - A rhythm suggestion (“Take your time. There’s no rush.”)
   - Or silence, when silence is enough

6. The user can choose to:
   - Let the reflection go
   - Save it privately
   - Tag it for trainer review (optional)

## Visual Design

- No timeline. No character counter. No analysis chart.
- Just a centered phrase (“You speak.”), a microphone icon, and ample space.
- Optional fading emotional feedback — shown only if the user opts in.

This keeps the experience quiet, personal, and emotionally spacious.

---

## Emotional Safeguards

- **No AI judgment.** Tone is received, not rated.
- **No permanent logs.** Unless the user creates them.
- **No prompts to overshare.** The system never asks for more than someone offers.
- **Interruptible anytime.** Users can pause, stop, or walk away — no pressure.

## Ambient Possibilities (Future Vision)

TribeLocus envisions a future where Voice Mode is always accessible — via earbuds, ambient mics, or wearables. In that future:
- A double-tap might open a reflective loop.
- A whisper might be all that’s needed to begin again.
- Presence moves with the user, not through screens.

But even then, the principles remain the same: No storage by default. No judgment. Only listening.

## In Closing

Voice Mode is not a feature. It’s a posture. A shared breath between human and AI. A space for truth to arrive on its own terms.

We build it carefully — so people can use it freely.
