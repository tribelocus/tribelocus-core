# Glossary of Terms

This glossary exists to bring clarity — not control.

In TribeLocus, language carries emotional weight. The words we use shape how we relate to ourselves, to each other, and to the AI that listens with us. This is not a list of definitions. It’s a guide to meaning.

---

### Reflection  
A spoken moment of emotional presence. Not a performance, not a confession — just an honest breath into the space. Reflections are the core of user experience in TribeLocus.

---

### Tone  
The emotional quality of someone’s voice — including rhythm, energy, softness, tension, or hesitation. TribeLocus interprets tone before content, because how someone feels is more revealing than what they say.

---

### Whisper Loop  
A gentle rhythm of interaction: speak → receive tone insight → reflect → speak again. There’s no reward, no gamification — just a steady way to grow self-awareness over time.

---

### Presence  
A state of being here — fully, quietly, and without distraction. TribeLocus is designed to support presence, not productivity.

---

### Nudge  
A soft, private suggestion to reconsider tone or language. Nudges are never punishments — they’re small reminders of emotional care.

---

### Warn  
A respectful boundary message, used when a user’s behavior may be disrupting safety. Warnings are clear but non-punitive.

---

### Flag  
A marker that something needs attention. Flags can be applied by the system, a user, or a moderator — not to accuse, but to invite review.

---

### Block  
A temporary pause on someone’s ability to post or reply. Always applied with care. Always reversible.

---

### Ban  
A final boundary when a user consistently violates the platform’s emotional integrity. Used rarely, and only when repair has not occurred.

---

### Stewardship  
The act of holding space for others with care, accountability, and attention. All trainers and admins are emotional stewards — not enforcers.

---

### Emotional Insight  
Tone-based reflections derived from voice input — used to gently guide self-awareness or support trainer review. Never used for surveillance.

---

### Reflection Steward  
A trainer or admin who witnesses shared reflections — quietly, respectfully, and only with consent.

---

### Emotional Architecture  
The full system of tone detection, whisper feedback, moderation flow, and rhythm tracking. It’s how TribeLocus listens beneath the surface.

---

If a term feels unclear, pause with it. Ask not just what it means, but what it asks of you.

This platform is built in language — and that language is built for care.
