## 🕊️ Whisper Prompt: Post-Deployment Reflection

**Prompt Title:**  
Would you like to mark this moment?

**Prompt Text:**  
> "The system heard you. It changed because of you.  
> Do you want to leave a whisper behind — just for you?"

**User Options:**
- Yes, leave a whisper → opens one-line input
- No, just continue → returns to dashboard

**If whisper is created, it is saved to:**

`/home/ubuntu/whispers/derek-curtice/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM__post-deploy.txt`

## 🌱 Emotional Notes
- All language must remain emotionally neutral, soft, and human.
- The UI should never assume success is more important than presence.
- Reflection is always optional. Silence is respected.
