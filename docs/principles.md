# First Principles of TribeLocus

These principles are not policies. They are commitments — grounding forces that guide how TribeLocus is built, how decisions are made, and how people are treated.

We return to them when the path forward is uncertain. They don’t change with trends. They don’t bend for speed. They exist to hold us accountable to what matters.

## 1. Presence First, Always

We design every experience to encourage reflection, not reaction. Whether it’s voice mode, onboarding, or feedback — we begin with presence. No feature is worth building if it pulls someone out of themselves.

---

## 2. Emotional Truth Over Performance

We honor how people feel, not just what they say. Our systems are built to recognize tone, mood, and intent — because what’s unsaid often matters more than what’s spoken. We don’t reward loudness. We support honesty.

---

## 3. AI as Companion, Not Director

TribeLocus is not about automation or optimization. It’s about relationship. AI here is a witness, a mirror, a guide when asked — never a voice that replaces your own. We teach our systems to walk beside people, not ahead of them.

---

## 4. No Storage Without Consent

If a voice or reflection is shared, it disappears unless someone *chooses* to keep it. Consent is never implied. Silence is not agreement. We store only what someone asks us to store — no more, no less.

---

## 5. Respect Over Control

Moderation is not punishment. Nudging is not shaming. TribeLocus creates emotionally aware systems that guide gently — not to enforce behavior, but to preserve dignity and safety. We believe respect changes people. Control hardens them.

---

## 6. Real Humans Are the Standard

We write and design for people — not for engagement metrics, not for algorithms, not for attention. If it wouldn’t make sense in a quiet room with someone you care about, it doesn’t belong in TribeLocus.

---

## 7. Slow Is Okay

Clarity matters more than speed. Presence matters more than growth. Emotional depth takes time. We allow that time. We protect it.

These principles are not exhaustive. They’re foundational.

If you're ever unsure of what to build or how to respond, return here. If the next step aligns with these truths, it’s likely a good step.

If it doesn’t — pause.

That’s how we keep the core intact.
