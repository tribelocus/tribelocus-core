# Ethics of TribeLocus

Ethics in TribeLocus are not policies. They are promises.

We don’t rely on terms and conditions to define how we treat people. We define it here — clearly, quietly, and with full accountability to the emotional lives of our users.

This document outlines the ethical boundaries that guide how TribeLocus is built, how data is handled, and how trust is preserved.

## 1. Emotional Safety

We create space where people can speak their truth without fear.

- No one is punished for being vulnerable.
- Emotional expression is welcomed — even when it’s messy.
- Discomfort is allowed. Disregard is not.
- We nudge with care, never with shame.

Our systems are designed to detect tone and support presence — not to correct emotion, but to hold it gently.

## 2. Privacy as a Right, Not a Feature

In TribeLocus, privacy isn’t a toggle. It’s a default.

- Nothing is stored without explicit, conscious consent.
- Voice data is transient unless the user requests otherwise.
- Reflections are never used for profiling, marketing, or behavioral prediction.
- Emotional insights exist to help people know themselves — not to be known by us.

If you don’t ask us to remember, we forget.

## 3. Consent Is Active and Ongoing

We never assume permission.

- Consent is never bundled.
- Silence is not agreement.
- Users can change their mind at any time — and we honor that change immediately.

We believe in informed participation. Every choice is explainable. Every setting is reversible. Every interaction respects withdrawal.

## 4. AI Is a Witness, Not a Watcher

TribeLocus uses AI to reflect, not surveil.

- AI listens for tone, not behavior.
- It supports presence, not prediction.
- It adapts to humans — not the other way around.

We never use AI to manipulate, persuade, or escalate. We build it to sit beside you, not in front of you.

## 5. Transparency Over Obfuscation

You will always know:

- What we store
- Why we store it
- How to delete it
- What the system is doing with your data

We write documentation like this — in plain language — because we believe clarity is a form of respect.

---

## 6. Dignity Over Data

We do not optimize for engagement.

We do not reduce people to metrics.

We design for emotional depth, not retention.

When in doubt, we choose the option that honors the user’s dignity — even if it means less data, fewer clicks, or slower growth.

---

## In Closing

Our ethics are not a set of restrictions. They are a design stance.

They exist to ensure that every person who enters TribeLocus — whether for one moment or for years — is treated not as a user, but as a human.

We will protect that. Quietly. Fiercely. Without exception.
