# System Architecture of TribeLocus

The architecture of TribeLocus is built around a single truth: emotional safety requires technical integrity.

This system is designed not for scale first, but for care first — each component chosen for what it protects, not just what it enables.

This page offers a high-level view of how TribeLocus works underneath: secure, modular, and privacy-first.

## High-Level Overview

TribeLocus is composed of five primary layers:

1. **Voice Capture Layer**  
   Handles secure voice input from web and future ambient interfaces  
   → Tools: local browser capture, optional S3 storage with signed URLs

2. **Tone Analysis Layer**  
   Transcribes and interprets emotional tone from voice  
   → Tools: Whisper (transcription), GPT-4o (tone summarization), Lambda orchestration

3. **Storage Layer**  
   Stores user-approved reflections only  
   → Tools: AWS S3 (reflection files), DynamoDB or RDS (metadata), encryption by default

4. **AI Interaction Layer**  
   Returns insights, nudges, and rhythm feedback through secure APIs  
   → Tools: GPT-4o, caching via Redis, signed API calls

5. **Admin/Trainer Support Layer**  
   Offers trusted insight viewing and moderation tools  
   → Tools: Admin UI, role-based access, ephemeral audit logs

## Key Architectural Choices

- **Serverless where possible.**  
  AWS Lambda handles voice processing, tone extraction, and emotional feedback — minimizing infrastructure risk.

- **Consent-based data flow.**  
  Nothing is stored unless explicitly authorized. Every function checks consent flags before action.

- **Tone-first design.**  
  Emotional tone is processed *before* text is surfaced. This keeps AI reflection grounded in feeling, not keywords.

- **Security at every layer.**  
  All user inputs are encrypted in transit and optionally at rest. Role-based access ensures no trainer or admin sees more than needed.

- **Modular + extensible.**  
  Each layer can evolve independently — enabling future wearable, mobile, or ambient integrations.
