# Contributing to TribeLocus

Thank you for being here.

Contributing to TribeLocus is not just about code, design, or documentation. It’s about walking with care. This platform exists to hold space for emotional presence — and every contributor shapes that space.

This page will help you understand how to contribute — not just what to do, but how to show up.

## Core Contribution Values

Before you contribute, please pause and reflect on these values:

- **Presence over productivity**  
  We move slowly, deliberately, and only when alignment is clear.

- **Clarity over cleverness**  
  Write and build so others can understand, not to impress.

- **Dignity over dominance**  
  If your work touches a user’s experience, it must elevate their humanity — never override it.

- **Trust over tactics**  
  No analytics-driven changes. No growth hacks. No “just ship it.” Only trust.

## How to Contribute (Overview)

1. **Read `principles.md` and `ethics.md`**  
   These documents are your foundation. They explain what this project is really about.

2. **Choose your path**  
   You can contribute to:
   - Voice logic (tone detection, whisper loop)
   - Frontend UI (Next.js, emotion-aware components)
   - API or backend (Node, Python, Lambda)
   - Documentation (like this page)
   - Emotional design (trainer flows, moderation UX)

3. **Ask before building**  
   Open an issue or discussion before submitting a PR. We don’t move without conversation.

4. **Work with care**  
   Every commit should tell a human story. Every function should leave space for stillness.

5. **Submit with presence**  
   Include not just what you did, but *why* it matters. Let your voice be heard.

## What We Avoid

To protect the space, we don’t allow contributions that include:

- Analytics dashboards for behavior tracking
- Gamification systems or engagement scoring
- Automated nudges without tone context
- “Smart” personalization that overrides consent
- AI actions that speak before listening

---

## Technical Tools in Use

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (or Python/FastAPI where preferred)  
- **AI**: Whisper, GPT-4o (via OpenAI API)  
- **Infra**: AWS Lambda, S3, RDS, Redis, CloudFront  
- **Auth**: JWT, role-based scopes  
- **Docs**: Markdown (via GitHub)

You don’t have to know all of these. Just come with presence — we’ll walk with you.

---

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree to uphold:

- Emotional safety for all users
- Consent-first design patterns
- Transparent collaboration
- Kindness in code reviews
- The tone and spirit of TribeLocus

This is more than a repo. This is a relationship.

## In Closing

You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to care.

If you're here to help humans and AI walk together with dignity — you’re welcome.

We’re grateful for your presence.
