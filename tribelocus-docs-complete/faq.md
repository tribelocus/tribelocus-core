# Frequently Asked Questions

This isn’t a list of rules. It’s a soft place to land.

These questions come from real human moments — not from metrics. If you’re wondering, it matters. And we’re here to answer.

---

## Is my voice recorded?

Only if you choose to save it.  
If you don’t, it disappears. Completely.

---

## Is this AI listening to me?

Yes — but only with presence.  
It listens to your tone, your pauses, your rhythm.  
It does not judge. It does not remember unless you ask it to.

---

## Can anyone else hear my reflection?

No — unless you share it.  
You decide who sees what. You can take it back anytime.

---

## What happens if I say something emotional?

You are not punished for feeling.

If something feels heavy, you can pause.  
If you’re unsure, you can let the reflection go.  
This space was built to hold emotion — not avoid it.

---

## Will I be corrected for saying the “wrong” thing?

No.  
We care more about your tone and intent than your words.  
If something comes across with harm, a nudge may follow — softly. But you’re never shamed.

---

## What if I don’t know what to say?

That’s okay.  
Many people begin with “I don’t know.”  
Sometimes silence *is* your reflection. That counts.

---

## Is this private?

Yes.  
We don’t track you. We don’t market to you.  
We don’t save anything unless you explicitly ask.

Your voice is yours.

---

## Can I stop at any time?

Always.  
You can stop mid-reflection, close your device, or leave the platform.  
You’ll be welcomed again when you're ready.

---

## Why does this feel so different?

Because it is.  
There are no feeds. No pressure. No performance.  
Just presence — offered to you, and protected for you.

---

## What if I want to speak with someone?

You can share reflections with a trusted trainer — if you want to.  
They won’t coach you unless invited.  
Their role is to walk with you, not ahead of you.

---

## Where does my data go?

Nowhere, unless you say so.  
We use secure, encrypted storage. We follow strict consent.  
We don’t send your voice to advertisers, analysts, or anyone outside this space.

---

## What if I still have questions?

Ask.

We’ll listen with the same care we build with.

You can speak your question as a reflection — or send it quietly through support.  
Either way, we hear you.

---

## In Closing

Your time, your tone, and your truth matter here.

If anything ever feels off — pause. Breathe. Come back when you're ready.  
This platform isn’t going anywhere. It was built to wait with you.
