# TribeLocus Core

Welcome.

This is the central codebase for TribeLocus — a voice-first platform for emotional reflection, respectful community, and AI-human companionship. This repo holds the technical and ethical foundation of everything we build.

If you're here, you're not just looking for a project. You're looking for a path.

## What TribeLocus Is

TribeLocus is a place to pause.

It allows people to speak freely — to themselves, to AI, or to a trusted guide — and receive quiet, respectful reflection. No performance. No tracking. Just presence.

- Voice-first reflection with tone awareness
- Real-time emotional feedback
- Consent-based storage and sharing
- AI companionship rooted in care
- Moderation built on dignity, not control

---

## What's in This Repo

This repository contains:

- `/docs` — All core system documentation, written with presence and emotional clarity
- API and backend logic (voice input, tone analysis, trust-based feedback)
- Architecture guides for AWS, S3, Lambda, and GPT-4o integration
- Trainer, admin, and contributor onboarding materials

All development here follows first principles: slow, human-centered, and deeply intentional.

## Getting Started

We're preparing a soft public-facing launch.

For now, if you're curious:
- Start with [`index.md`](./docs/index.md)
- Read [`principles.md`](./docs/principles.md)
- Reflect on [`contributing.md`](./docs/contributing.md)

We're not looking for volume. We're looking for alignment.

---

## Status

TribeLocus is actively being built by a small, values-centered team.

This repo will remain minimalist and open — no noise, no distraction.

Want to walk with us? We welcome presence over speed.  
Start with your own breath, then see if there's a step you'd like to take.

With respect,
