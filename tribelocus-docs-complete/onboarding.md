# Onboarding in TribeLocus

Onboarding in TribeLocus is not about conversion. It’s about welcome.

We don’t rush people in. We don’t flood them with features. We offer a quiet invitation to arrive — and then we walk with them as they find their own rhythm.

This page outlines how we introduce both trainers and clients to the platform. Not through instruction, but through presence.

## Core Beliefs

- People don’t need to be shown everything — they need to feel safe enough to explore.
- The first few moments matter more than the first few clicks.
- Emotional clarity always comes before technical clarity.

## Onboarding Flow (Overview)

Whether someone is a client or a trainer, onboarding in TribeLocus follows the same emotional path:

1. **Welcome with Presence**  
   A single centered moment: “You’re here. We’re glad.”

2. **Intent Setting**  
   Users are gently invited to share why they came — or to skip if they’re not ready.

3. **Tone Reflection Orientation**  
   A calm explanation of how voice, tone, and AI interaction work — focused on presence, not surveillance.

4. **First Reflection**  
   Users are invited into a voice-first moment: “Speak if you’d like. Nothing is stored.”

5. **Rhythm Introduction**  
   TribeLocus shares how it supports emotional pacing — not goals, not habits, but rhythm.

6. **Consent-Based Options**  
   Users choose what they want to keep, share, or leave behind. Nothing is automatic.

7. **Ongoing Guidance**  
   A gentle AI voice is always available. “Would you like a nudge, or some space?”

## Trainer-Specific Path

Trainers receive a slightly expanded welcome that includes:

- **Emotional Ethics Agreement**  
  A calm, affirming outline of how to support others without control or ego.

- **Reflection Stewardship Orientation**  
  How to hold space for someone’s voice — not analyze, not fix, just witness.

- **Nudge/Warn Philosophy**  
  Clear guidance on when to use tone-based moderation tools and how to do so with dignity.

## Emotional Design Elements

- **One moment per screen.** No overwhelm.
- **Soft transitions.** Pages don’t jump; they fade in.
- **Language that listens.** No urgency, no persuasion — just truth.

## If Someone Leaves

Leaving is part of the rhythm.

If someone pauses onboarding:
- Nothing is lost.
- They are always welcome to return.
- A gentle memory of where they left off is preserved — only if they ask.

## In Closing

Onboarding in TribeLocus is not the start of a journey. It’s the beginning of a relationship.

We don’t push people to begin. We wait for them to be ready.

And when they are, we listen.
