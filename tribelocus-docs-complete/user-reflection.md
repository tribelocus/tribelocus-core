# Your Reflection

_You can try a reflection anonymously. Nothing will be saved. No identity needed. Just you, your voice, and space to begin._

You don’t have to know what to say.

You don’t have to be clear, or wise, or ready.

You’re here. That’s enough.

This page will help you understand what a reflection is, how to speak one, and what happens — or doesn’t happen — next.

## What Is a Reflection?

A reflection is your voice, spoken in real time.

It’s not a post.  
It’s not a performance.  
It’s not a message for anyone else.

It’s for you.

You can speak about how you feel.  
You can speak about nothing.  
You can sit in silence and say, “I don’t know what to say.”  
That counts.

## How to Begin

When you're ready:

1. Tap “Begin Reflection”
2. Let your breath settle
3. Speak — or don’t
4. When you’re done, choose what happens next

That’s it. There is no timer. There is no judgment.

## What Happens After

When your reflection ends, you choose:

- **Save it privately** — It stays just for you. You can revisit it later.
- **Share it with your trainer** — Only if you want to. You can take it back anytime.
- **Let it go** — If you say nothing, we save nothing.

If you do nothing, your reflection disappears. That’s part of the design.

## How AI Responds

If you’d like, TribeLocus can gently reflect back what it heard:

- A tone insight  
  (“You sounded steady, even through sadness.”)  
- A rhythm suggestion  
  (“You paused a lot. That matters. Maybe stay with that.”)  
- Or silence  
  Sometimes, nothing is the most respectful response.

AI never evaluates you. It listens, reflects, and lets go — unless you ask it not to.

---

## Where It Goes

Nowhere, unless you ask.

- **We don’t store voice** unless you say “save.”
- **We don’t analyze behavior** or build profiles.
- **We don’t show anyone** your reflection unless you share it.

This is your space. We’re just holding it open.

---

## In Closing

A reflection is a moment.

Not a task. Not a log. Not a thing to get right.

You don’t need to know where it will go.  
You just need to trust where it starts: with your voice.

You speak.  
We listen.  
And if you want… we walk with you.
