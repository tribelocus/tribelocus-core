# Trainer Guide

Being a trainer on TribeLocus is not about fixing people. It’s about walking with them — one breath at a time.

This guide will help you understand your role not as a problem-solver, but as a witness. You are here to support presence, dignity, and growth — never performance.

---

## Your Role

As a trainer, you are:

- A **reflection steward**  
  You quietly witness what a client chooses to share — never more.

- A **guide, not a director**  
  You offer gentle orientation and rhythm feedback, not control.

- A **presence, not a prompt**  
  You show up with calmness, not scripts.

---

## What You Can See

You can only view a client’s reflections if they:

1. Choose to save a reflection  
2. Explicitly share that reflection with you  
3. Keep sharing active (it can be revoked anytime)

You’ll receive:

- Emotional tone summaries (not transcripts)  
- Time/date of reflection (not frequency stats)  
- Optional client notes if they include them

You will never see:
- Private voice files (unless shared)
- Transcripts of unshared entries
- Reflections stored without consent

---

## How to Respond

You are not required to respond to every reflection.

But when you do:

- **Begin with tone, not content**  
  (“I noticed a quiet strength in your last entry.”)

- **Mirror, don’t redirect**  
  (“It felt spacious. Thank you for sharing it.”)

- **Pause before suggesting**  
  If something arises, offer it gently. And ask if it’s wanted.

---

## Whisper Guidance

If Whisper Mode is active during live sessions:

- Speak calmly — the system reflects your tone too  
- Let silence happen — it’s part of presence  
- Use nudges sparingly and with care

Examples:

- “Would you like to sit with that before we continue?”  
- “That pause felt meaningful — no rush.”  
- “I’m here, quietly, if you need space.”

---

## Emotional Ethics

As a trainer, you’ve agreed to:

- Prioritize emotional safety over goals  
- Never coerce, override, or persuade  
- Let the client define their rhythm  
- Honor consent as sacred  
- Stay aware of your own tone and presence

---

## Boundaries

You do not:

- Diagnose or treat  
- Monitor or evaluate  
- Rank or assess  
- Record or archive  
- Recommend other users

If something feels too heavy, you may refer it to an admin or step back with care.

## First 3 Steps as a New Trainer

### 1. Read Slowly

Start with these documents — not to learn rules, but to feel rhythm:

- [`principles.md`](./principles.md)  
- [`emotional-architecture.md`](./emotional-architecture.md)  
- [`ethics.md`](./ethics.md)

Read not just what they say — but how they say it.

---

### 2. Reflect Personally

Before supporting others, speak a reflection of your own.

Try Voice Mode. Listen to your tone.  
Notice how it feels to be received without judgment.

If you choose to share your reflection with a test trainer (or admin), notice what that requires of you — and what it gives back.

---

### 3. Begin in Stillness

There is nothing to do. No message to send. No report to run.

Let your first days be quiet.

Notice what arises. Explore the interface slowly.  
And when your first real client shows up — be fully present.

That’s the work.

---

### Looking Ahead

We’re preparing a gentle library of orientation materials — short walkthroughs, voice demos, and story-based trainer reflections.

These resources will live in a private space for trusted trainers.  
Not to train you, but to walk with you.

You don’t need them to begin. But when you’re ready, they’ll be here.

---

## In Closing

To be a trainer here is to walk with reverence.

Not everyone needs advice. But everyone deserves to be heard — truly heard.

That’s your work.

That’s the invitation.

We’re grateful you chose to be part of it.
