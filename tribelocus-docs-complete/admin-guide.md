# Admin Guide

Being an admin on TribeLocus is not about power. It’s about protection.

You are here to hold the emotional tone of the platform — quietly, consistently, and without judgment. You witness, nudge, and intervene only when presence is threatened.

This guide will help you understand how to act with care — and when not to act at all.

---

## Your Role

As an admin, you are:

- A **tone steward**  
  You watch for emotional shifts in the community — not language violations.

- A **protector of rhythm**  
  You intervene only when someone is pulling the space out of alignment.

- A **presence amplifier**  
  You model respectful stillness and set the tone for the platform.

---

## What You Can See

You may have access to:

- Emotional trend dashboards (anonymous tone patterns)  
- Flagged posts or reflections (tone-triggered or manually flagged)  
- Shared reflections (only with user consent)  
- Nudge, warn, and block tools (used sparingly)

You do not have access to:
- Voice recordings without consent  
- Private user histories  
- Non-flagged personal content

---

## When to Act

You are encouraged to **pause first, act second**.

Use your tools only when:
- Someone is repeatedly disregarding emotional boundaries
- Tone patterns suggest unacknowledged harm
- A reflection or reply risks destabilizing the safety of others

---

## How to Act

TribeLocus supports a tiered, emotionally attuned approach:

### 1. Nudge  
A gentle private message:  
> “Would you like to revisit your tone? This space protects emotional presence.”

### 2. Warn  
A firmer reminder when patterns emerge:  
> “This is a shared space. Your recent posts may be affecting emotional safety. Please take a breath before continuing.”

### 3. Block (Temporary)  
Used when safety is at risk and reflection is not occurring. Blocks posting temporarily — never publicly, never with shame.

### 4. Ban (Rare)  
Used when someone consistently rejects reflection, disregards dignity, or creates harm. All bans are human-reviewed and documented with tone context.

---

## What to Avoid

You are not here to:
- Enforce rules by default  
- Correct people for being emotional  
- Silence disagreement  
- Act quickly out of discomfort  
- Favor one group’s comfort over another’s truth

---

## Working with Trainers

Admins and trainers may support the same users — but the relationship is different:

- Trainers walk with  
- Admins witness the space around

Admins may occasionally support trainer requests (e.g. multiple reports), but never override trainer consent flows.

## First 3 Steps as a New Admin

### 1. Read the emotional foundation
- [`moderation.md`](./moderation.md)  
- [`emotional-architecture.md`](./emotional-architecture.md)  
- [`ethics.md`](./ethics.md)

### 2. Witness before touching
Visit the platform without doing anything. Watch the flow.  
Let the tone teach you.

### 3. Set your presence
Your tone in admin messages — even when unseen — shapes the whole.  
Be calm. Be clear. Be kind. Always.

---

## Looking Ahead

We’re preparing a set of quiet tools for admins to support deeper presence:

- Emotional logs that summarize tone patterns (never behavior)
- Escalation tools with reflection pause flows (not just block logic)
- Admin reflections — spaces for *you* to pause, check your tone, and return with care

These will arrive gently, in rhythm with the needs of the space. You’ll never be asked to move faster than trust allows.

---

## In Closing

Adminship is not a badge. It’s a responsibility.

To protect emotional safety is to move carefully, listen deeply, and act only when action brings more dignity than silence.

We trust you. And we thank you.

You’re not just moderating a space — you’re protecting the possibility of truth.
