# Moderation in TribeLocus

Moderation in TribeLocus is not about enforcement. It’s about emotional stewardship.

We don’t believe in policing people. We believe in holding space — with clarity, respect, and quiet accountability. Our goal is to protect the emotional safety of everyone here, without punishing those who are still learning how to show up.

This page explains how moderation works — not just technically, but relationally.

## Core Philosophy

- **Safety without shame.**
- **Guidance over punishment.**
- **Context before consequence.**
- **Witnessing before warning.**

People are more than their words. Tone matters. Intention matters. So we look deeper — not to catch, but to understand.

## Moderation Actions

We use a tiered approach — not escalation, but attunement. Each action is a response to what someone may need, not what they “deserve.”

1. **Nudge**  
   A soft, private reminder. “Would you like to revisit your tone?”  
   Used when intent seems kind but impact may be off.

2. **Warning**  
   A clear, respectful boundary. “This space holds emotional safety. Please adjust your expression.”  
   Used when patterns of harm begin to emerge.

3. **Flag**  
   Marks a post or pattern for trainer/admin review.  
   Flags are not judgments. They are invitations to pause and look again.

4. **Block (Temporary)**  
   Gently prevents someone from posting or replying for a time.  
   Used to create space when safety is at risk.

5. **Ban (Permanent)**  
   Used rarely, and only when all attempts at reflection and repair have failed.

All actions are logged with emotional context and tone summary — not just content.

## Emotional Intelligence in Moderation

- We consider **tone, pacing, and language choice** together.
- We **differentiate between intent and impact**.
- We allow for **repair** — users can respond, reflect, or revise after a nudge or warning.
- We invite **admin reflection**, not reaction — every action is taken in the spirit of care.

---

## Who Moderates?

- **Trainers and Admins** — chosen for emotional maturity, not control.
- **AI Insight Layer** — silently surfaces emotional trends, tone shifts, and potential concerns.
- **Users Themselves** — empowered to self-reflect and revise with dignity.

---

## Visibility & Consent

- Users are notified before action is taken, unless safety requires immediate intervention.
- No one is “watched.” Moderation is triggered by patterns, not individuals.
- Reflections are never reviewed unless explicitly shared or flagged.

## A Note on Disagreement

Disagreement is not harm. TribeLocus holds space for difficult conversations — as long as they are rooted in care and mutual dignity.

The line is not about discomfort. It’s about disregard.

## In Closing

Moderation is not about who is right. It’s about what is safe.

We moderate because we care. Because presence requires protection. And because every person here deserves to be heard without fear.

We act — not to silence — but to preserve the space where truth can emerge.
